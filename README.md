- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jumaglen, a network engineer with more than 3 years of experience in computer network deployment, management, and troubleshooting. I enjoy almost every aspect of my work, but I especially enjoy the problem-solving side of it. I get excited about hunting down root problems and coming up with creative solutions to fix them. I especially love when I get to work with a team to do so.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying at the Technical University of Mombasa for a Bachelors Degree in IT majoring on Computer Networks.
- 💞️ My services are offered on a part-time, full-time or contract based working program depending on the clients needs.
- 📫 Reach me @ jumaglen66@gmail.com for any inquiries.
