- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jumaglen, a DevOps & Infrastructure engineer with 4 years of experience in computer network deployment, management, and troubleshooting. I enjoy every aspect of my work, but I especially appreciate the problem-solving side of it. I get excited about hunting down root problems and creating creative solutions. I especially love it when I get to work with a team to do so.
- 🌱 I studied at the Technical University of Mombasa for a bachelor's Degree in IT majoring in Computer Networks.
- 💞️ My services are offered on a part-time, full-time, or contract-based working program depending on the clients' needs.
